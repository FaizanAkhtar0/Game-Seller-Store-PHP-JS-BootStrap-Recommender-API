spec of course it go to be a bother have the game run even at base setting it meant to be a lavish and immersive game environment that have beautiful graphic quasi intelligent ai and a good rt track

moot she camp from a distance so that people who be come to get you dont know and get an axe to the back or the second you get pull down you get down again by the throwing axe if the devs balance her

handle a game where match be un winnable at time because of the bug or camp do what you want with the game it be fun once if you can not go buy a differnt game like friday the th or something editi

and observer need to pair up to call in fire support for example i wish rifleman could quickly mark enemy position for machinegunners and in turn the machinegunners could suppress enemy position for

civilization v have i get a civlization revolution feel when play this game with the dumbed down graphic the game run smoother the turn and movement run really seemlessly and it hard to even tell when it your turn that be say the game suffers from random crash everytime i start a game an online game my friend crash at least once due to a different problem each time i even felt the wrath of crash before i write this review all this be say the game start up quick than past civ game but still rap your ear with extremely loud music if you can deal with the occasional crash and the simple art style then civilization vi be your gamenext let talk about the content in the game civilization vi have civilization in total with the aztec be a preorder civ but available after the day launch for free to play now to compare this to civilization v after all it dlc be release there be civs now obviously we cant compare an at launch game to a game that have go through many dlcs and game update i expect civilization vi to have th same amount of civs after all it dlc have be release or maybe even more civs be a good number and offer a wide variety of replayability since every civ play differently whether you want to go to the conquest route that germany offer you or the cultural route france offer you every single one of your play style be therewhat do they add so a lot of thing have change from past civ game civilization vi now have tree to go down a science and a culture tree with the addition of the culture tree you know can specifically select which play style you want rather than rush science in order to get a cultural victory like in past civ game tech such a civil service be now in the cultural tree it now make more sense another thing that be add be amnenities and housing amnenities have now replace happiness and work the same way if your amnitity be too low your production will slow down and your population can revolt it seem though it not a big of a concern a happiness be in civilization v many a time do i have revolution on my hand because my happiness be too low there be also housing housing can affect how your population grows if you dont have enough housing your population will slow to a halt and will not expand near mid game housing tend not be an issue due to the new housing district which i will now talk about one of the cool thing that have be add that be not in previous civ game be district district can be build in a city and take the place of one tile and allow you to build specific buildlings a campus science allow you to build university and library it also allow you to use a great scientist on it almost each resourse have a district there be one for housing amenity science culture gold military and even production the district allow your city to look more diverse and be beautiful rather than the land just be farm lastly i just want to talk about the ai this be the thing that really drive me to make this review the ai suck they almost always hate you and will turn on you in a second civilization have trait that a player can try to appeal to and it determine whether or not they like you i will use rome a an example rome have trait one be a set trait that he will alwyas have and one be a random trait the set trait be rome like civlizations that expand the unkown can be anything it be the most difficult thing to appeal to more than one civ because their trait all vary largely there be a time that i become friend with a civ and then they denounce me the next turn the ai be very unstable and ghandi be stil a warmongering if you want a guarenteed win in civilization vi go down the militaristic path beacuse you will go to war with atleast nation whether you be friendly or not after read all of this youre probably wonder if i recommend you buy it yes i do recommend you pick this game upwhen it a cheap price the game isnt the price tag for the issue it have maybe if the price go down or they fix the issue that be present will i then recommend you go out and buy it now but if you have civilization v just stick with play it","id like to start with that ive rarely played simulation game never

gamepace through stuff like the decrease size of playarea and general size of map in relation to the amount of player and time to get into a new gameits satisfy and excite without ever get tedeous and only occasionally a bit frustrating but thats only because im fairly competitive in game like these and get can induce a slight form of frustration eventhough it be only due to my own competence or

do i suppose i might as well do a normal onetodays game market be flood with all sort of game triple a indie and some of which even make by one person sometimes one game show up outta nowhere and suprises u in the best way possiblestardew valley be one of these game after year of development concernedape eric barone bring u a near masterpiece stardew valley be a farming rpg heavily inspire by harvest moon when i first heard of the game it be only week away from release but it only take one glance at it to have me sell on it the art have be redo completely multiple time over the course of it development and the pixel art look great the style also very reminiscent of the aforementioned harvest moon at the start of the game you inherit your grandfather farm only to find it in a run down state and it up to you a the new owner to return it to it former glory the gameplay be very slow but thats okay since it be mean to be a long term project this be because you basically live your life in this game a you progress through day month and year you can farm fish mine cook socialize forage construct craft and more stardew valley have a lot of mechanic some rough than others but they compliment each other nicely what i personally didnt like as much be the fishing i dont know if it because im bad at it but it felt time wasting because of the result in the early stage of level your fishing skill due to the low amount of money youd get sometimes the control can feel a little bit lack but this do not severely handicap your experience in fact after the first hour which you will reach oh believe me youre basically use to it stardew valley have a storyline which you can follow but it not necessary so you can basically just do whatever you want to do the game have no end so you can also keep play for as long a youd like keep in mind that you do want to have some stuff do before year three though now that we get mechanic and control out of the way i can talk about what i like the most about the game the npc be scatter across the map and at first youll be urge to seek and meet them all most of the npc all have their own little backstory personality movement pattern and dialogue of which the latter two be also dynamically influence by condition a the weather day of the week season and so on you can befriend these npc by well err by do what youd do in real life of course give them gift every two day of the week barge into their home and hand them a bat wing only to leave as fast a you enter to leave them in confusion unless you give them stuff they actually like a you progress in your relationship with these npc youll collect small scrap of their backstory and eventually they will send you stuff yay keep in mind that it be thus useful to improve your relationship with certain npc first who fit your playstyle a their gift can sometimes prove quite useful some of these npc be also bachelor which mean that if you increase your relationship to a level high enough you will be able to marry them your spouse will then move into your home and they will provide you with dialogue item or they will even do chore for you daily the soundtrack be also redone and be quite subtle most of the time which fit the theme my favorite track be in all honesty marimba of the frozen bone stardew valley have a relaxing theme and it be a great game to just sink lot of time into i wouldnt recommend it if you have good stuff to do a that stuff will not get do in a world with an increase indie game market stardew valley stand out a one of these special accomplishment and it damn deserves to im suprised the game allow me the time to write this instead of make me play it","have play harvest moon on the game boy advance year ago and be absolutely addict to the game

majority of the resident evil player base this version be a complete remake not remaster of the original game build on the re engine that be create by capcom and use on the also very successful resident evil because of that the game have very beautiful graphic which help to create a perfect terror atmospherein resident evil you play either a leon s kennedy a rookie cop arrive for his first day on the work a a police officer in the raccoon city police dept or claire redfield a student who recently just arrive in the city to look for her brother chris redfield also a cop and one of the main character in the first resident evil gamethey arrive in a city take by chaos because of a viral outbreak that turn people and even animal into flesh eat monster see a the street be take by zombie they decide that the best course of action be to head to the police station a it most likely the safe place however that isnt the case and most of the story go on in the police stationthe game offer the viewpoint from both character in different more on the quote down in the review scenario which in the original game be label a scenario a and b which mean you have at least different play in order to see both scenario on both character so that pair with extra mode such a the th survivor and tofu dont ask which you unlock by finish the game mean resident evil have a significant re playability this game be remake from scratch use the late of capcoms engine re engine and have similar graphic to resident evil however it us the over the shoulder camera similar to resident evil instead of first person a change that fit really well with this gamethe game be graphically demand however it quite well optimized and run really well even in computer that be not in the recommended requirement rangeive see very few complaint regard bug or performance issue with the game the one ive see be actually relate to driver and not with the game itself so the quality of the game be very goodnow the pro and con pro wonderful graphic fantastic gore system familiar location to old school fan new location that make even the old fan surprise great re playability very well polished run very well good variety of character to play a main character th survivor character and extra character come in the free dlc free dlc with extra story reasonable price for such a good gamecons different scenario be actually the same with minor change so either a or b feel the same just some item and puzzle change zombie be ridiculously strong depend on difficulty you play on it can take up to head shot to kill one although it will usually take which be still insane can get repetitive a lack of coop or versus mode capcom try to improve the story but forget several important element that relate resident evil to the first game also a lot of interaction between both main character that happen in the original game be completely leave out of the remakeas you can see i be very impressed with the game not only it look nice but it also play nicethe original resident evil be my favorite game in the franchise ive play it a lot not only on my playstation but also on my nintendo so it no surprise that i be extremely excited and hype for this game fortunately capcom do not disappoint the game be absolutely amazing and be probably one of the very best game ive play in a forever heck it probably the best in the franchise right now it bring the psychological terror back to the resident evil franchise in a familiar yet new and exciting wayin my opinion this game be a masterpiece and even if you have not

the the original re i cant make a comparison between them however this game on it own be definitely an enjoyable experience the gun sound be great as well a the feel of each weapon there a feeling of catharsis when you get that critical headshot and turn that zombies head into blood pudding keep in mind though these arent your typical leave dead zombie these guy can take quite a few shot before theyre actually dead which be why you should to keep an eye on your ammunition and pick your target carefully item management and careful planning of what enemy you should kill in a certain area be an important aspect of survive in this game by careful planning of what zombies you kill i mean that these guy be bullet sponge like how zombie should be so you can run out of ammo if youre not careful however if you feel that the game get a little too hard for your taste you can always change the difficulty setting to your like which i think be good for people new to the resident evil series or casual player the graphic be also really impressive that hd burger jesus although you might need a real beef y computer if you want to play this game at max setting even with low setting it still look really nice though there two character you can play a leon kennedy or claire redfield both character story take place in the same area in the game but theres some slight variation to what area and item you get depend on the character you choose there also b scenario for both character which add a little more variation to the game but it really not that much different from the a scenario it be recommend though that you do the b scenario for the true end ill just leave it at that because i dont want to spoil anythingone criticism i have for this game be that theres an issue with the lighting where the screen get progressively darker during cutscenes and puzzle and that zombie tend to play dead a little too much however both of those be minor inconvenience so be it worth the price tag my answer be yes this be one of the few game out there that you can feel safe pay for a full game i cant wait for capcom to do a remake for re nemesis","really good game need some more diversity between

that their power generation be start to reach capacity so they need to upgrade their power plant so they decide to start use solar power but to use solar power properly you need battery but to make

purpose but to annoy you and make you spend time try to drive through a forest like patch of tuleps that be well serve a spike strip then there be the endless amount of boulder that serve no purpose but to get in your way and slow you down maybe if they could be break down into small rock or serve some kind of material purpose then it would be understandable but to have over half the item on the game to have no use other than to get in your way be more than a head scratcher the lack of any kind of compass map or any other device that would be able to help you navigate where you be go tofrom the game be still in early access so that could be the blame for the frame rate but make no sense that a few tether would cripple this game my pc be able to run any game that ive get on ultra so that be no the issue the game be actually pretty decent other than a few issue that could be easily fix freedom of take a blank canvas and building huge structure that help you maneuver throughout the world be something that i be really draw towards about half of my gametime be probly spend on build thing like this however the past hour of game time have simply be me try to find my way back to my base hour of drive through canyon just to get stick on a stupid little plant an indistructable plant that be not use for anything and have no purpose there also time where you will be dig and boom all of a sudden you fall through the ground while this have screw me over a few time most of the time you can figure it out to come back out where you fell through but this be quite a hinderancethe basic of the game be great havent come accross many bug other than fall through the floor but at time this bug will either get you kill or drop you to a low level in a cave which let you run around then eventually die of lack of oxygen because it be impossible to find your way back to your vehicle until they make some change and add some type of navigation i wouldnt really recommend this game you will get to a point where theres nothing to do but to drive around a mine but you will come accross these stupid little plant that make mine an impossible task","can not put this game down only buy if

be generous in give this game for free to those who already have the game all the dlcs it make me download it immediately and try it outfrom what ive see so far be that the graphic be improve yet only the enviroment the rock boulder roads tree cave etc all look good than in the original game it be easy to notice and it do make the game look nicer than before however that be basicly the only thing that be improve the enviroment get an update and that be it i notice the following maybe others will notice thing i didnt or disagree with me the character still look basicly the same with maybe the face be a bit smoother wood a in house and wooden structuresobjects still look the same or there be little improvement weaponsarmour still look the same hair look the same no improvement when it come to clip object pass through each other the guy who get execute before you sink half through the ground no smooth gameplay a in it be still heavily script and the character dialogue still dont smoothely follow up on each otherdespite the little change for some reason it take up massive amount of memory and i get lag all the time i run skyrim with ton of mod without a problem and here i cant run low quality normally not sure if that be my fault or the game not allot memory properlyin the end it be still the exact same game would i play it because it get a bit of an upgrade no i would rather play skyrim with ton of mod than a remastered version without them maybe ill check out more of the game later but for now ill go back to the original gamei would not reccomend it but purely

in time i give this game a thumb up have play monster hunter game since monster hunter freedom unite i have see the game change and evolve through the follow up game that come after that this be not the monster hunter of old but it be what i want in a pc port of a monster hunter game on the pc new mechanic new gather system new and old monster with more to come make me excited i look forward to see more content add and i hope the developer continue to do a splendid job address any issue that come along my top highlight that this game offer this game be approachable for everyone while i breeze through the monster like a hot knife through butter i chalk that up to experience in the monster hunter genre in general any new player that would pick up the game would not have an overly hard time get into the game ie they wont have the experience i have in mhfu when i couldnt get past the first khezu without hammer my head through a ton of trial and error fighting this game offer experienced player to feel acomplished with their in depth knowledge of how the game work to make it easy for them overall this game allow you to in most case go into a mission and come out of it use only the bare minimum of resource some may think this be a bad thing that it be too hand hold for new player but i like to think of it a put my experience to good use and have good result group hunt be challenge yet satisfy so far every group hunt i have have have be a success and i truly appreciate be able to play with my friend from around the world while the connection issue be bothersom for one of my many mission it be a very minor impact on my overall experience my top dislike for the game there be a lot of thing you have to remember to do before and during a hunt this be probably the only part that isnt very approachable for a new player ive gotten use to it but i still find myself forget one or two thing sometimes before leave for a hunt sometimes i experience fps drop while fight the kushala and teostra it have never cause me significant frustration have grow up with a potato computer in the past but i feel like now that i have a fairly decent game pc i should not be have such issue this game run my cpu hotter than any other game i have though that be more likely because i be air cool my cpu so this be subject to that fact computer spec o windows gpu asus ceberus ticpu amd ryzen xcpu cooler noctua nh lx se amram gb ddr hdd tb seagate hdd tl dr i like this game it be exactly what i want for the pc version of this game","dollar game be pretty good","this game be amaze highly recommend","this be a very good application for basically nothing just dollar and with that you can get a huge selection of wallpaper thanks to the steam workshop also i have always find wallpaper that move to be the cool so i mean this be worth it i need to add this first of all with the purchase wallpaper that you can get i would suggest not get those because when i purchase it it wouldnt let me use the wallpaper so i just wouldnt get those but other then that i would get this app","be you sick of the daily grind of work home sleep repeat for a major conglomeratewell stardew

perfect fruit or fishthe variety of it fancy yourself a a fisherman or maybe the regular fruit or maybe a cave diver or even a rancher breed the animal all possible herewhat i dislike where do my weekend go ive only play for ingame day and then im watch the sun come up over the horizon for a new dayalso quickly come to dislike bright sunny dayswould i recommend itif youre tire of your own job

and the devs be always quick to rectify the problem with the addition of mod this game be now my favourite game you can play it solo but for a good experience playing in a tribe be awesome the emmersion in this game be highly recommend this to anyone and everyonelike other game though it should be know that every user will have different experience which be mostly determine by their computer spec so the good you have the less you will experience many of the bug that be only see by user on low end pc spec","have play civ this be by far the bad entry in the series the ai agenda alone be enough reason not to recommend it a even on a basis level many contradict each other so nation a hat you for spread your religion and nation b hat you for not spread your religion you get attack for build a wonder because nation c feel entiteld to be the only wonder builder in the game but if you counterattack and take their city you get a woping diplo modifier for beeing a warmonger and it best not to talk about complete b war by proxy because nation d who now hat you for kill nation c just have enough envoy to get three neutral city to do their fighting for them with absurd amount of unit these state can somehow field overall a big step in the wrong direction and the expansion doesnt seem to improve this mess in any way just install civ again and spare yourself the disapointement","i have this game also on xbox and play it already before it come out on steam if your look for something chill while be creative or just explore planetsyes this game be some for you

character that interact with the game differently and many different benifits play the game with out the mod in itself be fun as well though rather simplistic this game remind me of a mix of minecraft

big member that have join the team it do really make a differencethe down side right now be that it pretty much an explorable planet no animal or tree really but not all planet can have tree and animal so hopefully some might be addedyou can fly to different planet that have some fast sun rotation that be really cool the multiplayer make the game though play solo wouldnt be too fun really unless you like mold the dirt into some awesome base which bring me to the point i kind of wish there be more ability of actual building maybe a way you can set up a green house with grow would be coolthe game be improve and im sure it will be awesome before it fully release so i do recommend the game","overall score main story side quest graphic art style gameplay sound music voice","love this

whole thingmost of thne game be about automate a factory on a d planet from mine raw resource to increasingly complex finish productsthe combat be basic at best and be mostly a way to stop you from grow too fast polution will attract enemy and if you cant reliably defend or attack their base you will lose in frastructureafter year of beta outside of steam the game be already fairly flesh out and stable and it have quite a few nice mod to expands on most aspect to tailor the expereince to your tastemore weapon and enemy more resource more complex product god mode whatever suit your tastesi have be play this game on and off for nearly year now and i be really enjoy itbut it not for everyone a the graphic be admitedly not the best and the increasingly complex production line that be require might confuse you if you rush without properly learn each stagethe story mode be a nice tutorial for those have no clue on what to do so this be a nice change from most of those survival early

crash late in the game just a you be about to win","great game to play woth friend recommend","very mild spoiler aheadresident evil remake be an example of the modern hype train over a genuinely good product go overboard and turn it into a godlet s clear two thing up categorically this be a fun fun game and a worthy remake but it be neither as good a the original nor as good a the disgracefully underrated resident evil remakelet s start with the basic remake re be a true sign that despite the end product s quality that capcom be completely out of idea and have resort to remake sequel in order to find something new and the fact the game be pretty darn good justifies their lack of imaginationbut i do wonder when this series will be permanently shelve re be good it be but not very re y while this one be good it be but doesn t really capture the feel and vibe of the original gamesfor example re remake absolutely capture the original plus massively improve on every aspect that time dictate need a new lick of paint it be for me hand down by far the best video game remake in history i didn t expect this one to match it and it didn twhat be good about re it s a fun stand alone survival horror which feel like outlast in place and re in others it be visually decent if not stun and the gameplay be the re engine gameplay the series have evolve into it be not the gameplay of the original even if you think it be it like re feel disconnect from the early game but even though that be a bit disappointing it s not the end of the worldone review make a very fair point the new police station isn t well design i don t like the new stair in the lobby and the navigation be horrific it be not intuitive and the frequent backtracking be a nightmarei also dislike the hoop you have to jump through to get the magnum i didn t get it complete the game without it but blow me if i didn t expect it to be give to me a part of the game no turn out you have to bend over backwards to earn it and i don t really agree with that i also don t agree with make chief iron office non standard plot either i didn t find the club key on my first playthrough so didn t get to see the backstory therebut this didn t ruin the game i know it sound like a hat review i really do enjoy this game but it in no way capture the magic of the original re and a lot of the change it make be frankly unnecessary it s a good game in it own right but it s perhaps a little overrated perhaps others be expect something different to myself but i want to play a game which felt like the game it be remake rather than a re engine contemporary take on itit didn t feel like i be in raccoon city it didn t feel like umbrella s lab and it didn t actually feel like leon kennedy not that i mind because he be the most boring and overused protagonist in the series history anyway give me jill chris and barry any dayit also bother me that leon scenario saw very little interaction with claire unlike the original for example no sherrie in leon till the end and her character be make kind of irrelevant in his first playthroughthere be also a slight bug whereby the so far summary on the load screen be illegible because it load too fast to readi also wasnt fond of the rejiggling of the order of game aspect and i didnt really like the change in the gun shop owner characterbut back on the point the game be good very good it have it fault zombie bullet sponge be just old and completely idiotic by now for sure and anyone thinking this game be perfect have very different standard to me but it isn t re re will always be the original s game s re remake and more recent hd remaster nail the old feeling while bring it into the present this one just doesn tbut i d still recommend it anyway","this game be the most over rat game ever","wlaupon singleplaysr tapi best","after read alot of review myself and a someone who buy the game on release and play the beta time over all i have to say be that this game be good but you can see why many would dislike it so lets go over a few thing about it and seequests a someone who have make about different character and playthroughs and a someone who beat it back before there be a single guide up for the game all i can say be some quest be a pain that be no lie but this game require alot of back tracking and reading and memory but even then you can screw a whole hour of quest chain up with simple thing such a accidently not save a npc or kill one or even kill one too early who may of be able to give hint or not pick up a right item in an areathis can kill it for some people but for me it be interest to see how every quest could be complete by simple dialogue tree or even have a item before the quest or even stuff it up all together and just brute force through it do i think some quest be yes do they drag a little bit sometimes yes but thats the nature of a long read and walk about rpgcombat now this be one that people love to on do i think it can be ball holy hell yes this combat can be either the easy combat in world or the hard most unfair combat in any game it most of the time come down to build and you character and companion some build be well then others but it all come down to turn base enemy first every fight t this mean every fight most enemy be allow to go first and will always use most big hit move possible to knock off your armour and magic resist leave you to your go and mercy of every enemy a they gang up on single target for good effectiveness but sometimes it aint all bad when ya get hang of it and do a fight time ya start to feel good when ya do a well place set of move during your turn and completely wipe floor use barely any poitons or scrollsarmourmagic resist now this be a mechanic i can see people hate cause i hat it to and still do in some case because sometimes end game tank can look like this you armour enemy armour and take this if you hit a enemy you do maybe damage per go while some enemy can deal depend on difficulty and level and this just isnt fun you spend the whole game get gold and item only for it to mean jack most fight story a someone who play o and genuinely enjoy every moment of it the story in this feels lack luster and very all over the place it retcons alot but it do add some neat twist maybe too many but if you only play o you may really enjoy this story take a a spin off or alt universe but i never play the other game bar osos but my best friend tell me everything about the entire lore of every other game so i do understand alot in the game but can see why some fan would hate itbut all in all this game be worth a playthrough if you play os and truely enjoy it and if you hate turn base rpgs then give it a miss and if you hate long reading and lot of drawn out questsmy final score i love it from start to finish and spend a good hour in beta and play the hell out of this and still do from time to time when im in mood for a bit of sin","this be arguably my favorite game of all time not because ive always enjoy harvest moon esq game but because stardew valley do it so damn well it rich in content wholesomely the art be please to see with the bright and clean pixel there be always something to do in it some of my favorite value in this game be the same sex marriage mechanic and the character be intricate and complex even though some of them may come off a arrogant and rudemy major complaint be how the character get bland in marriage and so do their personality you might want to download some mod in order to get more enjoyment out of the character themselves if you do plan on marry someone also go to note that the kid do not grow they be stick in toddler stage and can not communicate also go to note the dialogue in the gaystraight have no difference it a bit annoy but i be grateful regardless tl dr first you begin with nothing in game the end there isnt there always something to enjoy even if youre rich and have every fruit tree furniture item etc you can add another goal","dont starve together dst be very good survival game which doesnt need good pc to play it may be bore for you if you dont have friend to play with but

call a d minecraft even though it be much good than the one it supposedly copying terrarium be a fantastic game make by a team of developer who really love their job and actually care about their game a a real game and not a a product or a money making machine it be hard to put on word why terrarium be so great and why it can keep you play for as long a i do first thing first let start the breakdown do note that this review be write when terrarium be in it version graphic excellentfor a d pixel game the graphic on it be fantastically make everything look incredibly detailed and splendid it hard to find stuff in it that stand out a be particularly ugly although some enemy come close not because of bad art but because the enemy themselves be ugly a all bloody hell although you probably wont have enough time to enjoy the graphic when youre shoot stuff up soundtrack greatthe soundtrack in this game be unique and charm every piece of it be a work of art in and of itself everything in the game have some music to go along it although when youve play the same game for over hour listen to the same song youre gon na get tired because of the strongness that the soundtrack come in it enchances the experience in a very delightful way but after play for so long you grow tire of it because it the same music over and over againso for the first few hundred hour it awesome but after that it start get repetitive so i just reccomend that you go on the internet and find some remixes which be easy to do since the entire soundtrack be conveniently pack into one simple file that you can replace at any time except when the game be open of course and it will change all the music with the game be task of play the track a it need togameplay nail itthe gameplay be fenomenal and theres so much you can do in this game that youll easily lose week of your life try to do all the stuff you can do of course everytime you start a new save file it be the same thing but it never exactly the same thing there always a difference even though almost everything stay the same but dont expect that just because everything stay the same that your be not gon na get kick let me tell you this game hold your hand less than dark soul this game be un forgiving and ruthless at the same time it gon na kick your and once youre down on the ground stomp on your ball a couple of time it will only do it if you let it this game require a lot of skill in fast reflex and critical thinking but there be still a lot of thing you can use to make your life much easy and once you start get tire of the same old just grab yourself a backpack and go explore the forum for some mod some mod that i particularly reccomend be thorium joostmod alchemistnpc and more pet mod variety plentifulthis game ooze variety theres a really expansive assortment of weapon accessory and armor that you can use but also a giant ammount of possibility in building furnituring and even the enemy have a lot of variation specially the zombie and the demon eye those two combine togheter have over variation thats a fck ton of them every thing you can do have at least way about do it the possibility be endless and you will never get tired if you keep explore them all story what storythere be no story well at least not as much of a story a just shoot whatever you see so i cant rate this part multiplayer perfectif you know me you know that on my circle i praise and praise and praise terrarias multiplayer to no end it the quintessential best design multiplayer for me there be very little that the game actually change about multiplayer but what it lack in difference it more than make up by your own option you can choose to join one of team might have be expand in the future and get this every player have their own setting about pvp the pvp aspect isnt a focus of terraria anyway but have the ability to toggle pvp on and off at will without lose your offensive capability look at you gta online or anything for that matter be a big plus for me which i hope many survival game out there would adopt it although i know terrarium be a sandbox and not a survival per se but it really bring my to a boil in survival when people just kill eachother instead of you know try to actually survive anyway this system be fcking wonderful not only that but some weapon behave differently when use in pvp for balance pourposes like every homing weapon that do not home on player bottom line multiplayer be a guranteed certificate of qualityconclusion this game be impeccable and undescribably good if you havent play it yet go and play it you wont regret iti cant say anything else about this game because what else can i say that hasnt already be say if you be read this you havent buy the game yet and if you havent

rid of some of the flawsthe soundtrack of this game be awesome and the graphic fit the overall theme plus the character sprite be top notch the control can be a little unprecise and the menues tedious

the game be brand new it would get fix right the answer be no lol as much a i love this game and want to say play it it simply not worth support a group of developer who do not listen to and work with the community lately the main point for the crew have be new dlc hollywood killer new inovative idea the game doesnt need new cosmetic and addition at the moment it need balance on both side surivors have the end of the bug stick a they constantly have to deal with sound and exploit bug they have the more boring playstyle a pallet looping be basically the only thing they can do to survive and get point at a rate worth work for and killer dont even get me start i have never see a asymmetric game that doesnt give the less side the advantage so many good killer perk take nerfs and so many new killer get nerfed to the ground that at rank you upright cant use them and win the hitboxes for both killer ability and pallet be absolutely break at time it not fun hit a hatchet that be clearly a miss or get hit by a pallet from a mile away and the wraith update we wait ing year for it and the wraith happen to still be the next to worst killer when do it end this game be great but their be so much more wrong with it that isntt get tend to i still have hope for the devs but with all the talk about new dlc killer and map every few month it make me wonder when be the time to fix this game go

than play alone and have an item collection system that you can sell over the steam market the game do have a story but you do need to do a certain number of thing to beat it i dont know how the game be best play with more than two people but really any number be fine one last thing to add if you enjoy a spooky tim burton style game this be definitely for you but if you prefer fps game to hardcore

breaking bug after all the patch weve be through a game break bug shouldnt be presentmy wife and i both have the game our inventory have become mess up we think the only indicator we have be five blank spot when we go to craft inventory we have even track down where they come from during driftwood you have a quest strange cargo to rescue a guy in a barrel the moment you tell him to come with you he become part of your party in his inventory be five grenade item no matter what you do after that you will have blank space in your crafting inventory whether you kill him on the spot or lead him safely out of townyou might wonder what a few miss spot would matter a do we but when you get ready to leave act and go to nameless isle youll either get kick back out to the main menu during the cutscene or get crash to desktop if you get kick back out it give save error we havent be able to get any attention on the issue but i suspect more people may realize have the same problem a time go on and people progress through the story and theyll probably lose three day worth of progress like we do and really really not even want to finish the game anymore so until this be fix or maybe even if it do there gon na be at least two negative review on this game from u","i hope one day factorio and rimworld could come together and all the other sandbox game will die","very good i llike it just

blast for a while one thing i love be all the new update that come out all the time because there be always something new to see and try out that be until the late update in the late update tame dinos be pretty much make useless take away all those hour that i spend to get dinosaur that i could have fun just relax and rid around if you think ark be a cruel mistress before i wouldnt even bother try with her now after the dino nerf patch now if they do decide to fix this in the future then thing will be back to normal and it may once again be worth all the time that many people invest into it","it like what happen when you give headless chicken some automatic rifle and pan","i really want to enjoy this title but i cant get into it the new armor system be a let down you cant even taunt target without strip them of all their armor point first magic be extremely difficult to use without risk friendly fire some of the fight be extremely poorly design ship fight between act and im look at you and the devs love to gotcha by introduce enemy and element into combat you couldnt have know about before start the engagement much save reload and trial error require the illusion of choice be also especially bad basically you have the way the developer want you to solve the problem and then all the wrong way feel free to select the wrong way if you want thing to be more difficult on top of those thing i find the story to be an extremely typical you be the chosen one and only you can save the universe tale some very eye roll fondle over your character really turn me off of the plot the individual character story be more interesting but only make up a tiny percentage of what youll spend your time do which be mostly wander around large environment loot barrel and manage your inventory some final note crafting be a chore but at least it completely ignorable there a ton of thing to read but most of that be also easily ignore you will likely feel compel to play one of the origin character instead of make a custom character because you miss out on content if you dont graphic and sound be fine but nothing really stand out a outstanding the entire game be voice act which be great although that voice act be just serviceable lastly this be an incredibly long game which i suppose mean good value to some but to me mean bloat and poor pacing divinity lose me in act which be about half way through and i cant see myself play another hour of this","the bad so much money so little reward this game publisher owe the community big time civ be unstable and often you cant even

hostiliy and how escape one event doesnt neccesarily mean they wont be put in another the game can be very punish with the misuse of resource such a the attempt to gun blazing in to clear a area will cause you to run out of ammo much fast than someone who would just use what be need to bypass the enemy this be because of the absurd hitpoints the enemy get make the player learn to be conservative with resource a possible critical headshot in this game be rarethe visual design find in this remake will blow the old and newcomer into the resident evil series away with the amount of detail find in

experiance for some aspect of my play thruse pro update base world graphic asthetics and enb lighting seem to be nice and more true to bethesda fantasy but with good graphic so possibly may not need a many visual mod play for a short while look at many world texture and i personally be happy engine convert to bite allow game and some mod to function good on current pc this pave the way for potentially new mod that can do much more than before thats up to the creativeness of the community thoughse con unofficial skyrim patch be not integrate into the base game to my knowledge i do not know if bethesda perform any offical bug fix to the base game or not but my hunch be we will still need the unofficial skyrim patch to fix alot of thing in the world some player have try the patch on skyrim se but it seem to cause problem so we need to wait for the mod to be update to work well with skyrim se old texture on armor weapon equipment house hold object dungeon object and thousand of other item dont look update to me look forward to the static mesh improvement mod hd weaponarmor mod to be convert to skyrim se not look for non skyrim itemsequipment mesh just would like high quality mesh for exist skyrim equipment kinda the bridge between lore friendly and well look not old pc friendly if you run skyrim on highultra year ago you might be at lowmedium setting today with skyrim se if youve update your computer since then like i do you might still be at highultra no npc or character meshskin update still have origional character looksfeels will need modding to touch up some people wait for cbbe to be convert dont judge me gt gt many old mod may never work again unless the mod author come back to update it or another mod author take over the project and try to update

leave little of what it originally be im not say it bad not by a long shot for the hour ive play i appreciate the extra terrestrial look of the planet not barren not overly decorate with flora but still alien overall the look of the game make it feel like youre return to earth many year later and life have just evolve take the tree for example they bar leaf unlike any youed see on earth but now they just feel like adapt pine tree gameplay be great it just the aesthetic of the game and the menu that have change for the worse","great app and you should buy itits worth it","ing great game be

this game i think the gameplay and mechanic be amaze but the game crash be not worth the grief if you join a large tribe and always have a tribe mate near you it might be fine because they could save

of the precondition for stimulate terror in human this game be terrific and at time terrify it can also be heartwrenching it be more than survival but it be survival at it most basic i wont give spoiler aside from say it a horrific shame to be here in this amazingly beautiful world alone i have play a couple of other survival game but this one actually give you the total sense of isolation while communicate with you you have no one to talk to but your pda talk to you and it not just mind numb information you cant talk to your pda however be i really to be in this situation i would be talk back to my pda the same way i talk to my screen when i play sometimes i laugh at the comment sometimes im just like no sharding sherlock but it really do communicate with you not just talk at you and by that i mean that the information be meaningful and not just data i have find a place where the biome match out of the condition by the way and one of those condition be a sense of hopelessness i do however manage to limp my way backthe beauty of the game world be captivate and alive you dont long for life and the place feel far far from dead you do long for others however and be with others be always just out of grasp subnautica motivate you to do everything it drive you to explore it drive you to build it drive you to work toward a sense of normalcy when there be no normal anymore subnautica push you to face your fear and to actually dive deep in every aspect of the meaning in the begining you be totally helpless and while that situation improve some you be never the big fish for all the tech at your disposal you have the mean to survive but never the mean to dominate you be actually in over your head be in over your head however doesnt take away all hope ever and push you to explore and challenge yourself and go far and deeperthe sense of what could be never go away the sense that you need to leave remain the sense that you will miss this place when you do grows and grows but you know one thing you cant stay and even know that you will miss this place and all the effort you put into it you know you cant really come back for a vacation either and if you do it wouldnt be the same part of the beauty be the isolation and the isolation while lead to despair at time be part of what make it feel so amazing be you to live in this world with a group of people it would be ruin measure would be take to ensure that humanity become the big fish and the big fish be part of what make this world what it be i wouldnt mind survive with a partner but the one thing that be most out of place in this world be you and be anything to change it it would be ruin that be part of why you cant stay i feel not just due to the isolation but because you be actually lucky to be alive and see what this world have to offer","great game for the driving simulator enthousiasts out there this game be fun to play work great in term of control and be be update once in a while the thing i like personally be the abiltity to use keyboard controller and steer wheel to control the truck the function to use real radio and even edit the file contain the audiostreams adresses and

review a it have a great potential and ive be for year since i preordered look forward to see this game finish and work a you would expect ive play hour to this game mainly with a friend in an official server make our own stuff the game be fun tame dinos and rid them be fun and enjoyable but be aware of the follow the game have be in development for year and be still not optimize it will probably never will grind expect hour of cut bush and smash rock for material you need for building seriously it ridiculous i rly hope they change this in the other version of the game survival of the fit this be not an issue a game last h prepare to come back to your base just to see it completely destroy always i hope you find friendly people in your server it a nice game lot of potential and cool idea very bad optimization very high price for such an old game i think developer should have follow another matketing strategy before release a year old game for buck","i get the game a while back and i would have like it if it have not be for the lag which be horrible even though i be on low setting minimum graphic make the game all pixely and arent playable and while i do use a laptop it a gaming laptop it a gaming laptop and from what i read and have see it should be able to play it while have it still look nicebut hey i really dont know if it me r the game so maybe you should buy it but make sure to clean out any virus on your computer a i believe i have one before buy the game","dev and publisher out for that cash grab instead of actually improve the quality of the game charge for a game pas on top of the game be a perfect example locking reward behind a payway be another slow development for bug fix and focus on thing they can get a monatary charge out of their customer for a game that have such massive potential when it be release in alpha they have fall mile behind competetors in the genre","for stardew valley it isnt the whole game that be great it every indivdual thing that be part of the game be what be so great the character the mining and combat the fishing and especially the farming this game be actually quite strategic in the way that you plan out what you will do each day depend on the weather or other factor it isnt just a playing game it be also a thinking game and it doesnt get enough love for how good it be","this game be clearly my favorite game it be amaze i be into these d game like terrarium but this be just good than the other one like starbound which i also like dont listen to people who compare it to minecraft because it be much much different","amazing experience cant wait for the expansion","great app it add life to your wallpaper however it base on community contribution so it need more time to shine and grow recommend","nice game much fun if play with friend _","love this game my favorite part have to be without a doubt the profile picture for the people you can hire within the game i dont even care what their starting skill be i always go for the god damn weird look person in the catalogbut anyway this game be exactly what it say it be in the title which be to accurately simulate the titillate experience of drive on road in a truck that also happen to be in europe so always make sure to turn off auto speed limiter in the option menu which let you go above kmh because you get ta go fastoh yea and you can never have to many headlight","one of the best simulation game ever make if you be look for a game where you dont have to press a dozen button in few second and adrenaline action stuff but purely sit back relax and enjoy this be for you amaze detail and excellent scenery i would play this forever cant put the damn game down","go get the oringal copy of skyrim a the in game modding browser suck","im sad to see all the negative review towards this game bit and so much cleaner of a game to play now it just a port for people to enjoy the game again with easy mod access","incredibly entertain to play with friend and mod","unlike gta iv this be surprisingly well optimize","the randomness get stale after a while","best game in the gameverse","honestly it just a nice game that can go many place one of the only problem i currently have with it be that when it night time everything get too dark to see but at the same time that be also good so people wont go out and pvpraid at night also in the morning the sky and surroundings get too red for sunrise cause my game to completely drop in fps me and my friend refer to the sunrise in rust a satan spawn otherwise great game cant wait to see it become developed further","it the classic gta formula you know and love except mostly big and good but not in every way overall the gameplay and movement feel nice and fluid id say it the best out of any gta game so far i do use a controller with the auto aim enable though i find that use a controller be much more enjoyable for move around in third person and driving vehicle but aim with a controller can be tedious so i turn on the auto aim to fix that i try switch constantly between keyboard and controller but it be too clunky so i decide to stick with a controller with auto aim each main character have an unique special ability that make drive shoot more fun and rewarding than ever a lot of world filling content basically a large amount of content that make the world feel alive and believable while add a touch of humor and satire this include side quest dynamic event tv channel internet websites radio station billboard text message email civilian discussion and more a lot of video setting to tinker with what youd expect from a good port first person mode be a great addition the main character be great very good acting trevor be hilarious for the most part the story be generally pretty good overall if you think of it a some sort of parody soundtrack be ok some good stuff some less good stuff thats really subjective though while the realistic restriction have be somewhat reduce from gta it still not perfect for example you cant do fun thing like try to jump from rooftop to rooftop or car surf your character leg be just gon na give up and go into ragdoll mode that can be funny at time but it more of an annoyance than anything and you can even die unintentionally because of it the mini game tennis etc be a nice distraction but again they be a bit too realistic to be fun for more than a few match the novelty wear off quickly another realistic restriction i didnt like be how you cant permanently save a car in your garage i mean whats the point of modding a car if youre go to lose it forever when you inevitably leave it behind or get it destroy and the realism be weirdly inconsistent because the car of the main character always spawn back at their safehouse no matter what you do with them so i dont get why theyre not allow u to save our own car permanently too a bit too much of the main story revolves around of the main character be childishly mad at each otherif you absolutely want a score id probably give it a mostly for the sheer amount of content and the good stuff generally outweighting the bad stuff it honestly a great game and despite it flaw it still one of the best game of it genre","i much nicer feel to the game than the last one","unlike the resident evil and remaster resident evil be so completely remake from scratch it might as well be a whole new entry to the franchise it feel like the natural evolution the series would have go in have it not veer off it survival horror rootsas much a i love the original game and want a remaster of it in the same manner of resident evil and i can not deny that this remake be an incredible achievement and have thoroughly change my mind so much so that i would be overjoy if old entry in the series be remake to this degree","and i think tf be the best game in steam","i hear you like load screen so we put abunch of em inin all seriusnes though some poor lobby

to ragdoll the out of the cage fly about like a madman before settle down halfway through the wall after this incident it be pretty much smooth sailing until i arrive at the large room just before the drawbridge to the end cavehere of the archer decide gravity be not his deal and fly up halfway into the ceiling and proceed to suffocate and die after clear the room he be still stick up there in the ceilingmoving forward into the area with the drawbridge ralof go up and pull the lever afterwards he start levitate up into the ceiling and fly over the drawbridge area into the cave area bounce up

focus fire them to death before you get your turn to heal them save too often save bloat can break your save and it unfixable want to pass a speech check whoop the game keep select a character who you didnt level persuasion on so you cant the freedom be amaze early on but it become quickly apparent that the last act wasnt bug test or balance at all if the final act be actually fix and low on bug id

early access and more content be always appreciate the core gameplay loop be complete and very entertaining a quick browse show the developer update the game on a weekly basis and seem fairly

playedfirst word that come to my mind be deep immersion developer create a huge beautiful and very realistic world subnautica be mainly focus on exploration and it be extremely good in fact i think that there be no enemy in this game at least i could not perceive any creature a enemy they be not monster but just local fauna that live their life in fact they be not even alien they be at home and you be not invite there be only one alien on whole planet and this alien be you once you learn behaviour of animal you will very rarely encounter any aggression if for some reason you want to fight well you may find a prey but bloodshed be absolutely senseless and unnecessarygame be quite peaceful but it do not mean that there be no danger in ocean pressure lack of oxygen cramp cave limit light deeper and deeper you go more and more awe you feel when your submarine hang over the abyss and you can see nothing but endless cliff and depth it be scary well i hardly can remember another game that give me such intense emotionsworld in subnautica be open for exploration from the very start you can travel well everywhere still amount of accessable location be cleverly limit by available technology you can try to explore deep cave immediately after planetfall but without supply of oxygen you will just drown so game softly push player to explore safe shallow firstthere be storyline and in my opinion it be very good i do not want to spoil anything just want to say that storyline be simple but intense yet not intrusive in same time bit by bit you will visit all location and learn all mystery final scene give me very complex and positive emotion it be beautiful and full of hope with light sadness it be worth all long way downgameplay can be divide into two stage during first stage you salvage technology gather resource and craft equipment there be some grind but i can not say it be boring or tedious you just explore surroundings and study local life gather useful item by the way and second stage be travel when you gather enough resource and craft basic vehicle seamoth you can explore almost everywhere there be only three vehicle in game not too much but they be widely customisable you can install different module extra armor torpedo launcher defensive electric field and so on also it be available to change appearance of vehicle such a colour and finally you can even give your vehicle a nameyou can construct your base that will serve a center of operation constructing be simple and effective it be very easy to learn and comfortable to use there be lot of different module you can combine and create your awesome station even more importantly game offer a lot of different furniture and decoration to customise your base and turn it to well not just a base but your home i really get attach to my tiny but comfortable underwater apartment and my tamed cuddlefish i really hope that my pet will survive without me wait it be just a game sighof course i must mention the stunning beauty of subnautica blaze sunset dense kelp forest impenetrable darkness with sparkle of luminescente flora and fauna almost every scene literally crave for screenshot a for sound and music they be excellent such quality be really impressive for example i humbly advise you to search for tropical eden melody it create amazing magical atmosphere i be truly enchanted withgame be not perfect there be some bug several time i see fish swimming in my base once during exploration of aurora wreck i get stick in texture and then suddenly fell out of the world well all this tiny confusing trouble seem insignificant for meprobably the best advice i can give do not watch video and do not read guide explore by yourself believe me pleasure from discover new thing be worth the time if you love adventure game with main focus on exploration subnautica be a sure bet honestly i do not know any game that can compete with subnautica in this niche you do not want to miss

well do each monster feel unique and every encounter feel like an epic bos fight you come out of the fight feeling accomplish cant wait to sink hour into this game i have barely scratch the surface definitely recommend","rip gta v rip rockstar rip take two","great gameamazing graphic","i be not one to write review positive or negative really about any game i play but after play this game for k hr and willingly survive all manner of bug cheat and troll i have find the thing that i think be unnacceptable in any game which be the ability of other player to completely shut you out of the game i be currently in someone base cuffed to a bed be feed and water and under ac so i cant even play move kill myself or otherwise like i say i have a lot of hr so pls dont explain to me how to kill myself in these situation assume i have try it all i be literally lose food or water sit here online for over a day now i leave my computer on to see what would happen and sure enough im still lose no stats because of this environment somehow my character have decide to also stop defecate so there be no way to die at all i cant even be rescuedkilled by my team because i be in a glitched location where the tribe have a giga park inside bite through wall while i feel someday the devs might actually listen and ban cheatersmake this form of prolongued capture bannable atm i be the tribe leader of a tribe that have no ability to play i be not start a fresh character and support a game that think this be gameplay if you arent actually play it be not gameplay i be sit here not lose a single stat in

probbably waste good hour before you can stop","i have over hour into the game compare to a lot of ark player im still a noob so if you arent ready to turn this into a full time job dont even bother think about get this game ill explain why this game be a full time job later on but basically it punish any player that cant or wont play it first ill talk about the pve i start play pve on a private server with friend and have ton of fun discover everything there be to enjoy we start on the center the big and in my opinion the coolest of the three map the beginning be the hard part for new player every dino you meet can easily kill a noob even the spitter dinos it can be annoy run around naked and get kill by raptor but stick with it and find your friend and build a safe place once you get the base build the game get so much more fun every new dino you find be cool and it so fun the first time you get all your friend together and explore a cave the most dangerous foe we encounter in pve be the alpha predator our base get kill multiple time by alpha raptor but it be fun because it show u that even though we have a big base with spike wall and gaurd tower there be still a threat out there that have to be beat ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame fly mount you dont have to worry about dangerous expedition so late game it get bore we basically get to the point that nothing pve have to throw at u outside of bos battle be a challenge and even fight boss have no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill hard version of that bos thats why we decide to turn to pvp to see if that be good late gamepro tip dont pvp this game be design in such a way that the big tribe that be on top stay on top new tribe and new player just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave let walk through all the reason pvp be horrible alpha tribe they wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new player base and kill their dinos they own the server they wont let anyone else even enjoy the game unless youre alpha you dont get a base they might let you live in a thatch hut refer to reason unless youre alpha you dont get to tame dinos they might let you tame dodos refer to reason unless youre alpha you dont get to upgrade any of your gear alphas block all loot drop the good one anyway and fill all the cave with auto turret to gun down anyone that try to explore them alpha tribe be literally impossible for small tribe to fight they have huge metal base with hundred and hunderds of turret and plant that will mow you down if you so much a look at it wrong rocket get shoot down in mid air by these turret and you wont get close enough to plant c you wont be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either refer to offline raiding just imagine work for week build a pretty cool base completely surround by plant x and tame about dinos then log on to see a smoking crater where you base be you dont get to save any of your gear you dont get to save any of your dinos you dont even get to fight back it all just go this happen all the time and honestly offline raid protection should be baseline on all server battlemetrics alpha tribe and griefers use this website to figure out if you be online or not if you log off for some reason sleep or work or whatever then they will know and they will raid you they can even get text alert that tell them the second you have log off or on or if anything else unusual be go on on their server basically this site and site like it be cancer also it doesnt tell them your in game name but you steam name that mean even if you make another character they will know it you also if you them off and try to go to another server they can just look up where you go use battlemetrics and come find you there be no hiding and no escape so you have to be nice and cant even pvp or else some loser with no life be go to come and find you on every single server you go to breeding just another way to keep big tribe ontop they have huge metal air condition room where they hatch egg at once each hatch dino gon na be x the level of anything a noob will have tek gear if the fact that they have x well gear by monopolize all loot crate wasnt a big enough edge if the fact that they have x well dinos by build huge breeding room wasnt a big enough edge now they get tek gear too if they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos you be dead ark be a full time job you must log on every day to fee dinos or they will die breeding and imprinting be horrible and time consuming process that i wont even touch you must log on every day to make sure you havent be raid and you must grind hard than everyone else to make sure you have the defense and dinos to stop raider dont try you wont look im tire of type this review just know that if you enjoy pvp because you enjoy win through skill then dont pvp no pvp skill require at this point their gear will have much high armor and damage their dinos will have much high hp and damage just accept your death and wipe multiple time because you will lose everything and you wont even be online to defend it not like youd have a chance if you wereedit i never expect my review to actually be popular but now that it be i feel like i should address all the kid tell me i suck and that im still a noob who doesnt know what hes talk aboutfirstly this be not a skill base game this be a grind base offline raid base exploit base game you cant come here and say im a noob especially when ive play the game solo a a small tribe for over hour and i join an alpha tribe for a week or two so i know how it go on a large scale my opinion actually get even bad after join the aplha tribe because i realize just how bad the game pander to these alpha tribes here be some more reason i find from my time with the alphas why i will never recommend this game to anyone alpha tribe can grind resource way easy than a new player now you would probably expect this after all they have more player so it be only natural that they could send out to grind while your tribe could only spare no number isnt even what im talk about here im talk about exploit with a farming dino and a quetzal a noob with a hatchet can get wood from a single tree an alpha tribe can get wood from a single tree a noob with a pickaxe can get metal from a vein an alpha tribe can get metal from a vein a noob would take hour to farm k metal an alpha tribe can farm k metal in an hour the list go on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amount much fast and easy now noobs wont know how to do this and wouldnt be able to because quetzal be hard to tame and hard to hide from alpha tribe if they saw you fly around harvest they would bring a wyvern after you and start look for your base large scale pvp be extremely laggy the server be suppose to support up to player but if you get more than player in a server the lag become unbearable once again alpha tribe exploit this by log a many people a they can onto a server kind of like ddos to block out defender from connect or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid take damage from thing","so far this game and it devs be amaze and i hope they continue and grow togther to make an awesome game","even if i have do all there be to do i be always look for a reason to keep playing this gamei want to dig a hole to the center of the planet i want

they blend in so well with the enviorment the ingame voice chat also get preety toxic but there arnt many squeaker","i love card game of all type i grow up play traditional card game like crazy eight solitaire and uno i later get into bridge rummy and poker until magic the gathering mtg consume my life for yearsthese day though it hard to find people to play traditional card game anymore and magic the gathering and other ccgs be way too expensive to keep up to date witha few year ago i discover physical deck build game like dominion thunderstone race for the galaxy and many more i have a ton of fun play these but again it be hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so i turn to the pc several of these game have pretty good pc version but they be still restrict by the fact that they be base on physical game there be often clunky mechanic that really slow thing down thats fine when play with friend at home but over the internet or alone against an ai it tend to get old pretty fastthere have be quite a few digital card game recent year that be great but most of them be base on card collecting and those can rival even magic the gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cardsthen come slay the spire a game it take me week of hear people talk about before i finally give it a chance this little weird look card game have somehow manage to tap into so many thing i love about card game and video game that when people ask me about it i struggle to even say anything about it because there be so much i want to saydrawing your card the reason i love card game today as much a i do a a kid be for the simple feeling you get when you be deal your card you pick them up and see if you have a good hand that rush of excitement at the possibility of what your hand have for you never get old it why i get so heavily into magic the gathering since appose to game like bridge or rummy you get to draw new card constantly this be also true for deck builder and even more so with slay the spire than many others since you play your hand fast and dont have to worry about build your deck while youre play it this bring me to my second pointbuilding the deck slay the spire have do a genius move by take the deck building aspect of a deck builder away from the action of play so when i be in a fight i dont have to think for minute about which card to get like you have to do in dominion style game after a fight be over you be reward with a selection of new card and only then do you have to make decision about what card to pick and that choice be always inform by how the last battle go so you know what your deck be miss before you pick your new card i really love building my deck a i play with it it how i use to tinker with my mtg deck back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building game appeal so much to me slay the spire have the incremental building of a deck builder but without the constant stop and think style of play which slow those game down this make the pacing of the game much more interesting you have an action phase follow by a thinking phase rather than jumble them both into each otherplaying the card all this would be for naught have the game not be fun to play thankfully the card be interest and have a ton of cool interaction with each other there be many different type of deck you can build and they can often change and adapt a you play if you find that one rare card or relic you can build a whole deck around this make the game extremely re playable more so than any other deck builder ive played while game like dominion and thunderstone have a lot of different card combination for you to play i simply find myself enjoy what i can do in slay the spire more it also play very fast it flow a bit like heartstone in that sense unless you have very complicate deck combination which require some forethought or specific play ordersbest of both world since slay the spire be a digital card game rather than a physical one it be not restrict to the law that govern how a regular card game play this mean they can do a lot of stuff that simply isnt possible or take too long for physical game each fight be against one or several monster who before your turn indicate what they be go to do over their head which usually be either attack block or apply some buffdebuff this mean what you do on your turn be inform by that if the monster attack you block if it block or buff itself you attack have this kind of ai interaction in a physical game could be possible but would require a lot of dice roll or bore set up between round a you play the game more you start to learn how the different monster work and develop strategy for each of them make each game a little easy than the previous it not just your deck thats get well it your ability to play it a wellthe game also have a lot of status such a buff and debuffs kind of like how mtg work which be one of the reason why mtg can take forever to play but with the game be digital all this be take care of in the background the digital version of magic the gathering handle these thing for you as well but since it root in a physical game it be a lot slow and more cumbersome than slay the spirejust one more turn i be also a huge turn base strategy fan civilization be my favorite game of the genre that genre have the ability to captivate me in a way that make me just play on and on one more turn at a time even though i know i should have stop hour ago slay the spire do the same thing for me each game of slay the spire consist of floor with multiple encounter with a bos at the end of each floor if you die or win you get some experience point towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run it play similarly to a rogue like in that way a genre that ive always be fascinate by but never get very deep into but slay the spire get it hook into me very hard it take me quite the force of will to say no to another game so i could take the time to write this review i cant wait until it over so i can try out the late patch which remind meearly access the elephant in the room in my opinion be the fact that the game be in early access that to me be always a huge red flag there be a few game though such a factorio rim world subnautica prison architect oxygen not include and others that actually listen to their community provide regular update and already have a game that be worth play a it be slay the spire in my opinion join the rank of these great game without question the technical aspect of the game be top notch it play smoothly theres a ton of content and it have receive multiple significant update over the few week ive play it with a clearly define roadmap that promise more content in a game i feel already have enough content to justify it price time over i have no doubt that the game will be finish and even if development stop today i would be more than satisfy with my purchasefinishing thought this be a game i be go to be play for year to come and while it already have enough content to justify that today i can imagine limitless possibility for it in the future more game mode such a infinite restrict card special relic or modifier new card more monster new character etc i feel like this game have manage to do one of those thing that you dont really see all that often it have take the best from many different genre combine it in a new way and create something great than the sum of it partsi think slay the spire be a game we will be talk about for year to come a a genre defining game it have my full recommendation","product receive for free gmod be such an amazing and creative game fill with possiblities","i cant seem to play this game anymore the last six month the game have never

hope they fix the stability with vehicle in multiplayer and address the ease issue get to play with your friend because i be really bum out when my friend and i couldnt play this together there so much potential here im glad it alpha and not beta test phase there be still a lot to work on but it really funmy opinion the gravity need serious work with how it appear to be use a single thread to calculate which slow down processing and increase latency dev side of thing i hope that they do make the game more stable and mp friendly and that they give that update the glory it deserve because

with music and animate","if you want a quality game without ton of random nuance please buy the divinty original sin this game butcher a lot of that game charm but quickly cut off it face and wear it around a a facade sourcery feel flat and weak and almost entirely pointless at time due to it just be suck out of you like nothing by most every enemy you come across not to mention theyre oftentimes weak and eat your ap like no tomorrow when you can do comparable damage or effect for the same amount ap some of the combat scenario you will go through be also just tedious and can take upwards of an hour and a half per fight even when you be spend less than two minute per character turnslight edit the difficulty be also superficial in their difference tactician spout on about in it description about how enemy have special effect and think more about their move in truth the enemy have double your base stats double vitality phys and magic armor and quite often double your damage they also commonly outnumber you mean that you be up creek without a paddle the first voidwoken you spot upon land on the beach have vampire which let them lifesteal damage they do some enemy have a bonus spell that spice thing up usually a summon or something else of the sort that also have double your stats it not even a fair way to play the game because you often have to abuse game mechanic and essentially cheat with quicksaves and quickloads to get anywhere i be by no mean a noob at this game either i play a coop save with a friend in the first original sin where we both pick lone wolf which render u lock to a two man party we function a a team and get through the playthrough easy peasy a a first playthrough that be a fair challenge this game difficulty be nothing more than joke to play on people expect a tactical difference in how the ai functionsthe big kicker and the most apparent reason for my negative review be that the game be horribly optimize for radeon card i have an amd radeon r fury sapphire and it absolutely begin to cook under the pressure of this game cod within six minute of start the game mind you this be only at the main menu my graphic card temperature jump from degree celsius to degree six minute on the menu i have a water cool system and near to seven fan in my pc that be all optimize to keep my tower as cool a possible for comparison i can play doom on ultra graphic at x resolution for hour without my pc try to become an easy bake oven the problem persist even on the low graphic setting a if it just want to fry my gpu once again something that happen in no other game regardless of graphic setting this game be absolutely a hog and even the devs know it because they always talk about need to remove peripheral from your usb or shut off all non essential program what be this a pre flight check up just program your game well and give amd card a fair chance with optimizationthis problem be not just me either many other amd user base on community post support ticket and forum post have have similar issue be just be flat out unable to play the game because it crash their graphic driver if you be an amd user avoid this game and buy it predecessor a game you will enjoy far more this might seem like pointless rant but a a consumer who have test multiple thing to adjust how this game function when i cant even play the game with my

guide be all word a playable tutorial would be really helpful in anticipate what to expect in game so they put one in and entry be far less prohibitivethat say the game be good quite enjoyable as long a youre not expect a win ever there an unfortunate rng that take place i have a run of game where i would start within visual range of the killer usually when i use rare item that be hard to come by i mean it a game but i hate lose without make mistake but if youre cool with game like that this game can be quite enjoyable the last thing to keep in mind be the highly toxic community for every gg theres a go f yourself player disconnect when the game isnt go their way way too often it a constant thing and the devs encourage this by not punish those who do it regularly i know it seem like i didnt enjoy the game but i do it fun theres a few killer who be still scary and the mistake like freddy dont loom hard over the game","ill start by say that when ark be fun it fantasticbut there be so many problem with the game the official server be impossible to play on private server with friend be fun but theres so much grinding private server on your own be bore because it just grinding this

die after grind for hour to get scuba gear an icthy and a plesiosaur saddle and more that i have with me because it be all part of tame the plesiosaur there be more problem but those be the main one i could think ofhighest setting graphic be great though","this review apply to terraria and earlierthe essence of terrarium be that it prioritize fun it not a game where player must fear lose progress

besides there be much to discover and do in the game clock in at hour have all achievement and introduce multiple friend to the game should be indicative of that with that be say ill list some proscons ive find memorablepros customization there be a staggering amount of customization available in game you not only can choose from several basic character design but also have a plethora of armor costume accessory and pet for your character you can also colordye any of your equipment and get all sort of flashy effect dye arent consumable so you have few restriction on perfect your assemblage exploration the terraria world may be finite but it be incredibly diverse each biome have it own personality and house many unique element it take a minimum of three world to discover everything and thats only with absurd luck see the creation of the guide painting the game additionally have an impressive number of flavor that rubble on the ground can be dig up and a worm might pop out from it you can reignite the burnt out campfire in that small cavern you didnt think that npc could fend for themselves during a blood moon or invasion do you just when you think youve learn everything about the terrarium world you discover something surprising creativity terrarium be as much a about create your world a it be explore it block and furniture be not just for aesthetic but they also introduce some neat mechanic player look to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraption possible by the wiring mechanic and designer will love be able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of color terrarium feature innovative design at it fine progression option like any good rpg theres a great sense of progress make in a playthrough you mine or slay enemy for the material need to upgrade equipment and the world be bountiful enough that this progress never feel linear or constrain even the achievement flow nicely never feel too easy cheap or absurdly difficult you never need to rely crutch item to make progress rather in my experience my friend and i frequently have too many option and have to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot there be always something to switch to if a playstyle become easy or repetitive balance a game can become boring if there be a certain playstyle player fall into terrarium manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at complete the game there be no bottleneck or singular infinity sword need for progress diversity terrarium promote itself a a game for any type of player and that claim certainly have truth in it the game have gameplay suit for battler explorer and builder and i can also tack on several option that appeal to other type of player collector will balk at the quantity of item and achievement offer and player can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct play with only meleerangedmagicsummoning weapon sure a yo yo only run thats popular no craftingmining certainly play the entire game upside down of course and thats bug free if thats not enough you can fire up a world in expert mode for the extra challenge there something for everyone ive have a friend who would ask on his first playthrough can i do ____ in the game and i could answer in the positive the majority of the time just for starter you can teleport build trap fill dungeon set up pvp minigames and record the soundtrack the game breadth be incredible automation terrarium would be daunt without any form of automation you have thousand of item hundred of monster dozen of mechanic and an expansive world to build on or dig through the game offer much to ease the burden of management auto select pick the right tool rather than require manual selection the smart cursor allow for one click digging quick stacking be much more convenient than deposit item one by one chest by chest farming be not only feasible but easy make measure build be simplify with item like the ruler the game naturally provide the player ease of use tool so a playthrough can be focus on the fun stuff rather than on chore performance many game fall off a prospective player wishlist due to system requirement terrarium be a game that feature a crazy amount of sprite particle effect physic light and entity interaction be a d game only net you that much speed before optimization come into play coughstarboundcough the game requirement be reasonable and the gameplay be optimize such that it doesnt require a bulky system to run on i be able to run it decently on a year old desktop on window xp with low end specification the performance of the game to medium and some low end system make it accessible to a broad demographic of player on the other hand if you have a high end system go ahead and fire up that color light mode and enjoy terrarium in it full glory quality of life many game have little quirk that people have to accept to enjoy not only be terrarias gameplay mainly devoid of bug but it also buff out these quirk player be separate from world allow for easy singleplayer to multiplayer transfer character can ascend block without need to jump chest contain item dont explode if you try to harvest them key be easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control scheme quick stack skip favorite item you can use the in game system for take wide screenshots for giant

popular a it be to offer game expansion a pay dlc the developer instead make their continued update absolutely free to owner of the game the developer community relationship be superbcons new player friendliness the in game help system be stunt and player can easily become overwhelmed by the ever grow number of toy in terrarias sandbox many people resort to a guide to help them through the game grind while the game do not require noticeable grind to progress several tangent in the game require patience and luck that fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitate a farm in the hallow the last component of a pda could be hundred of monster drop or fishing quest away at a rate of one quest per in game day the fishing quest achievement would require minute day to complete without resort to trick it can be frustrate to have an achievement be leave incomplete a a stretch yet terraria be not above this issue moddability terrarium be extensive enough that it doesnt need additional

good than the one it supposedly copying terrarium be a fantastic game make by a team of developer who really love their job and actually care about their game a a real game and not a a product or a money making machine it be hard to put on word why terrarium be so great and why it can keep you play for as long a i do first thing first let start the breakdown do note that this review be write when terrarium be in it version graphic excellentfor a d pixel game the graphic on it be fantastically make everything look incredibly detailed and splendid it hard to find stuff in it that stand out a be particularly ugly although some enemy come close not because of bad art but because the enemy themselves be ugly a all bloody hell although you probably wont have enough time to enjoy the graphic when youre shoot stuff up soundtrack greatthe soundtrack in this game be unique and charm every piece of it be a work of art in and of itself everything in the game have some music to go along it although when youve play the same game for over hour listen to the same song youre gon na get tired because of the strongness that the soundtrack come in it enchances the experience in a very delightful way but after play for so long you grow tire of it because it the same music over and over againso for the first few hundred hour it awesome but after that it start get repetitive so i just reccomend that you go on the internet and find some remixes which be easy to do since the entire soundtrack be conveniently pack into one simple file that you can replace at any time except when the game be open of course and it will change all the music with the game be task of play the track a it need togameplay nail itthe gameplay be fenomenal and theres so much you can do in this game that youll easily lose week of your life try to do all the stuff you can do of course everytime you start a new save file it be the same thing but it never exactly the same thing there always a difference even though almost everything stay the same but dont expect that just because everything stay the same that your be not gon na get kick let me tell you this game hold your hand less than dark soul this game be un forgiving and ruthless at the same time it gon na kick your and once youre down on the ground stomp on your ball a couple of time it will only do it if you let it this game require a lot of skill in fast reflex and critical thinking but there be still a lot of thing you can use to make your life much easy and once you start get tire of the same old just grab yourself a backpack and go explore the forum for some mod some mod that i particularly reccomend be thorium joostmod alchemistnpc and more pet mod variety plentifulthis game ooze variety theres a really expansive assortment of weapon accessory and armor that you can use but also a giant ammount of possibility in building furnituring and even the enemy have a lot of variation specially the zombie and the demon eye those two combine togheter have over variation thats a fck ton of them every thing you can do have at least way about do it the possibility be endless and you will never get tired if you keep explore them all story what storythere be no story well at least not as much of a story a just shoot whatever you see so i cant rate this part multiplayer perfectif you know me you know that on my circle i praise and praise and praise terrarias multiplayer to no end it the quintessential best design multiplayer for me there be very little that the game actually change about multiplayer but what it lack in difference it more than make up by your own option you can choose to join one of team might have be expand in the future and get this every player have their own setting about pvp the pvp aspect isnt a focus of terraria anyway but have the ability to toggle pvp on and off at will without lose your offensive capability look at you gta online or anything for that matter be a big plus for me which i hope many survival game out there would adopt it although i know terrarium be a sandbox and not a survival per se but it really bring my to a boil in survival when people just kill eachother instead of you know try to actually survive anyway this system be fcking wonderful not only that but some weapon behave differently when use in pvp for balance pourposes like every homing weapon that do not home on player bottom line multiplayer be a guranteed certificate of qualityconclusion this game be impeccable and undescribably good if you havent play it yet go and play it you wont regret iti cant say anything else about this game because what else can i say that hasnt already be say if you be read this you havent buy the game yet and if you havent buy the game yet go do so already for fcks sake","addict fun wwo friends mod","a beautifully craft rogue like card game you have different character with different strength and weakness as well a card and relic that alter the

single corner of iteach battle be challenge fun make me use different tactic and i never get tire of fight the game balance roleplay and combat perfectly in some rpgs the combat be fine but the story and character be what keep you play however in original sin i didnt really care for the story while original sin keep me interested at all time it really improve on the lore roleplaying and combatits definitely a good sequel and one of the best game of i only have two complaint romance have no effect on the end and the amount of puzzle in the gameit would have take me a lot more than hour to finish the game because of the puzzle now dont get me wrong the puzzle be all interesting and well execute there be some simple puzzle moderate and very hard one i just dont have too much time to play video game and since there be so many puzzle in the game i have to resort to use google way more than id like to admit now the romance and with it some minor spoiler ahead i decide to romance lohse at the end of the game she ask me if i would like to travel the world with her and i cant answer her all i can do be end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tell me that she spend the rest of her life travel rivellon alone just dissapointingbut what be the game about whats the story likeyou have the ability to use source a powerful and outlaw magicmagic use by the god themselves it what give them powerthe game start with you be capture by magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use source they take you to an isolated prison island while there you make new friend discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliance while try to escape the island you will meet dragon witch paladin underground fight arenas demon troll ghost and much much moreyou will also uncover conspiracy and astonish secret will you be the new divinethe game itself play alot like the recent xcom game it basically a turn base roleplaying game not to worry tho you can still create a custom character and choose their stats race gender and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre make character there a wide variety of class to choose from as well all

have to show for it be a naked character do not buy it insanly easy to raid someone and not realistic to defend your base","after hour i feel like im ready to say my piece about this game it important to specify that im playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water the game will be very different depend on which mode you play because in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without ever have to stop what youre do to gather nourishment in hardcore you have to be extra careful because once you die you have to start over at this point im glad i do not pick hardcore because there be way you can die that just arent forseeable there also occasional bug in the game which result in your death like the all too common dive reel malfunctionsfirst impression this game be amaze that can be and be say about many game but there be nothing like subnautica i have be wait for year ever since play the crap out of the incredibly immersive fun but ultimately flaw sub culture finally we have a game that surpass sub culture in every aspect except the storyline with that say subnautica have flawsthe bad in all it glory there be a few nags some of which make the game increasingly difficult a you get far into the game first im go to get it out of the way that there be a startup bug that make me almost request a refund even before get into the game subnautica doesnt always start because the game menu screen frequently refuse to fully load this be probably some sort of gpu initialization issue that prevent the graphic from display properly in any event i have to exit out of the game and restart it in window mode to get the game to finish loading at allalso the learning curve be very steep there be no instruction for anything and the information give on any device in the craft menu tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff do there be some basic description but theyre very poor for example the current generator say it generate current when i start play i have no idea what i would want to create a current forthe third thing be the max depth of the in game vehicle there be much debate about the actual depth of the game some say it go on forever others have quote that the game crash out at meter some have say meter others have say there be a secret world in the great depth which sound pretty epic in any event the ocean go deep than i feel comfortable thinking about the problem here lie in the fact that the vehicle seem to have a max depth of meter ive since find the cyclops can go to approximately meter at the expense of power efficiency i believe the seamoth can also go to a comparable depth fourth the hunger and thirst meter drop far too quickly this seem nitpicky when you consider i do pick the survival mode but the problem with this system be that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that become increasily more difficult to find a the game go on a a result you might find yourself spend almost half your time gather food and supply to make water which lead me to the next problem in the gamefifth scarcity of food and supply for make water at first everything be plentiful and readily available salt while a challenge to find when you dont know what youre look for seem to respawn readily and limitlessly coral while seemingly limitless at first begin to disappear rapidly after many hour of gameplay moreover i have see no indication that it respawns food which pretty much come from the natural fish stock can disappear amazingly fast from an area after hour of game i have effectively clear all of the initial shallow of the ocean plus the surrounding depth of fish it amazing how fast they diminish the only solution seem to be to put respawning or fast reproduction of the fish in the game i have not see any indication that the fish respawn at all which seem clear by some of the dead zone i have in my current save there be some pretty heat debate about this in the discussion group naysayer claim the supply be unlimited and all you have to do be look further my answer to that be that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meter energy and other resource to find food because of this there be a rapidly diminish return on the value of food and water in the game the devs claim it cause people to explore more im not satisfy with that response because the reality be this if people have no motivation to explore if they just stick to the shallow and eat and drink they arent go to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway apparently a fix be be test in the experimental mode but it come all too slow to a stable buildsixth and my final gripe and this be definitely as glaring a the fifth scarcity of resource copper quartz acid mushroom be plentiful at first but become ridiculously difficult to come by a the game go on quartz be practically use in everything because you need it for glass and rubber which you need for building and make power cell to power your vehicle each power cell take a vast amount of resource which would not be as much of a problem if they didnt deplete so rapidly even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use power cell and leave you scramble for resource many user have default to the same argument they have give to the food shortage problem that theres plenty in the depth the problem be that it take more and more energy food and water to farm this stuff you end up trap in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminish marginal utility on all of your resource this really need to be fix or user will basically be drive out of their own game by scarcity both of the last two problem have people vehemently defend the current scarcity with the argument that resource be scarce in real life i would like to point out however that one person alone in a wilderness do not leave vast expanse of land void of any life certainly these rich biome should be able to support just one person also if the player be able to hunt for shellfish and crustacean in the game diversity of food might help low depletion rate the player should be able to find oyster and dig for clam the good base on my criticism some might get the idea that i dont like the game that couldnt be more wrong subnautica be hand down simply the best underwater game ever make theres no competition the environment be rich full of wonder and among the most immersive game ive ever play the world be pack full of fascinate creature beautiful vegetation and unparalleled undersea effect the graphic be compliment by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine all of it add up to a game that make you feel like youre live rather than playingits one of those game that come along and really change thing forever at least among those who have play it in my opinion the game hasnt get nearly the recognition it deserve the amount of stuff you can do in this game and the painstaking attention to detail be mindblowing those be thing i hope never change with subnautica many early access game be dumbed down in late iteration unknown world entertainment seem to have a good attitude about add new feature instead of take them out like some other developer of early access release have do in the past i just hope they maintain the trendsubnautica be an oustanding game worth it price about three time over it come with my high recommendation in it current state i would give subnautica a add the game have be hugely update since this review","a must get game ing awesome
